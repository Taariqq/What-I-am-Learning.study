        <p>Hello. (notices something) What the hell is this? (He presses a button.) (v.o) Lithium mode on. That's better, damn kids. (walks up to his son) Hey Ace. (Marty Jr. ignores him and continues watching TV.) Watching a little TV for a change? (Outside) (Marty has just put his 1985 Nikes back on. He looks around, and sees a dog being walked - by a robotic lead. Marty stares at it, and then gets up to have a closer look at it. He walks down the street. Biff gets into the DeLorean and unseen by Marty, takes off, although he crashes into some boxes first.)</p>
      </div>
      <p>(grabs Marty's shoulders) My God, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. (takes off the contraption.) Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works. Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine. Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for crying out load I haven't even been born yet. And, look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, class of 1984. (Doc takes the picture with a pair of tongs and looks at it.)</p>

      <p>(Griff looks. Marty tries to punch him, but Griff catches Marty's fist and smiles evilly at him. Marty then kicks Griff and Griff lets go. Marty then pushes him into his gang and they all fall to the floor.) (Outside) (Marty leaves the Cafe, passing Biff cleaning Griff's car. Looking at the square, he sees two girls on scooters. Marty runs over to them.) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! (pause) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop, little girl, little girl, stop. (Marty lifts the girl off her scooter.)</p>

      <p>(Biff kisses Lorraine. Marty can't believe it.) No!!! (He steps backwards - into the arms of 3-D, Match and Skinhead. Skinhead grabs Marty.) No! Hey wait, you're coming with us upstairs! Let me go! Sonny, we can do this the easy way or the hard way.</p>

      <p>He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life. Never? No, why, what's a matter? Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. Right.</p>

      <p>(o.s) Don't you be a smart ass! Marty Jr.(o.s.) Oh, great, it's the atrocity channel. (Lorraine puts the pizza in a Black and Decker Hydrator.) Hydrate level 4 please. (4 seconds later, she takes the pizza out, and it’s become full size.) Mmm. Marty Jr.(o.s) Is it ready?</p>

      <p>Well, Biff. Alright, punk, now… Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that? (Marty runs out.) That's Calvin Klein, oh my god, he's a dream.</p>

      <p>On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc. Ohh, no. No, Doc. Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry. Yeah.</p>

      <p>Red! (Red looks at him and then walks off. Marty gets a look at Courthouse Square. It's now full of strip bars, adult book stores and the like. There are bikers everywhere - it seems Hill Valley is hosting a biker's convention. Marty looks again. There is a toxic plant in the Square and a tank owned by the Hill Valley Police is driving around. Marty looks at the Courthouse. It's now a high rise building. The clock has been removed and extra stories have been built on top. Then Marty gets the biggest surprise - it is now BIFF TANNEN'S PLEASURE PARADISE!!! A neon image of Biff using a money bill as a cigar can be seen. At the top of the building is the word "Biff's" in big neon letters. Big chimneys are also polluting the air.) (Pleasure Paradise) (Marty crosses the square and walks to the Pleasure Paradise. To the right of the main entrance is the Biff Tannen Museum. There's a TV screen playing. Marty goes to watch it.) (v.o) Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Biff Tannen Museum, dedicated to Hill Valley's number one citizen, and America's greatest living folk hero, the one, the only, Biff Tannen. Of course, we've all heard the legend, but who is the man? Inside you will learn how Biff Tannen became one of the richest and most powerful men in America. (The TV screen shows Biff driving away from a big house in an expensive car.) Learn the amazing history of the Tannen family, starting with his great grandfather, Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, the fastest gun in the west. (The TV screen shows a picture of Buford.) See Biff's humble beginnings, and how a trip to the races on his 21st birthday made him a millionaire overnight. (The TV screen shows a racehorse and then Biff after his win with his money. Afterwards a copy of the Hill Valley Telegraph appears on screen – “Hill Valley Man Wins Big At Races”.) Share in the excitement of a fabulous winning streak...(The TV screen shows the Hill Valley Telegraph – “Biff Wins Again”.) ...that earned him the nickname, "The Luckiest Man On Earth". (The TV screen shows the Hill Valley Telegraph – “The Luckiest Man On Earth”.) Learn how Biff parlayed that lucky winning streak into the vast empire named Biffco. (The TV screen shows Biff outside one of the Biffco plants.) Discover how in 1979 Biff successfully lobbied to legalize gambling, and turned Hill Valley's dilapidated Courthouse into a beautiful casino-hotel. (The TV screen shows the Hill Valley Telegraph – “Gambling Legalized”.)</p>

      <p>My horse threw his shoe. Seein' you was the one who done the shoeing, I figures you was responsible. Well since you never paid me for the job I say that makes us even! Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that just caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I figure, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse. (realizing) That's eighty dollars! Look, if your horse threw his shoe, bring him back and I'll re-shoe him!</p>
