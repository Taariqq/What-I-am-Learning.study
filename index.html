    <p>This is to test if the PHP updates auto-update after placing an html file in the folder. Currently php files are not showing changes in browser upon save. Do the html changes show up?</p>
    <p>Nop! they are not showing up.</p>
    <p>A workaround would be to use "live reload", but the problem is live reload for linux is not currently working on chrome. So, we have to fire up Brackets to use their 'live reload'.</p>
    <p>It still does not work. After we fire up Brackets' live reload, we have to activate chrome's live reload as well.</p>
    <p>does that work? Well yes, it does, wal'hamdolillaah</p>
